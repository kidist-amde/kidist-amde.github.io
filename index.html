		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Greetings! My name is Kidist, a recent MSc Data Science graduate from the University of Trento, Italy.
			I have a strong foundation in programming languages, statistical methods, and machine learning models
			and frameworks. I have earned two Master's degrees in Machine Intelligence and Data Science, as well as
			a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  I am enthusiastic about continuous learning, having pursued various
			online courses and participated in a range of AI-related events, including conferences, workshops, summits, and 
			hackathons, to enhance my knowledge and skills in the areas of AI and Data Science.
		My research interest lies in Generative AI and multimodal learning (vision and language), specifically in the context of social good.
My main objective is on promoting positive outcomes, such as explainability,
 fairness, robustness, scalability, privacy, safety, and ethics, to ensure accountability and transparency in AI development.
</p>
		<p>
			Aside from my studies, I like being outdoors and going on hikes to explore new places. 
I'm also a big fan of  Science fiction literature and movies as I find the concepts and ideas fascinating. In addition, 
after a long day of work, I like to unwind by listening to Ethiopian music.

</p>
		
		
		<h2>Ph.D. Research Interest Area</h2>
		<p>
	My research interest centers around creating explainable deep learning models that can mitigate biases towards historically marginalized groups
in generative models. Specifically, my goal is to investigate responsible practices for text and image generation and examine the biases 
inherent in generative models such as  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). Furthermore, 
I am interested in exploring in investigating how modern Language Models (LLMs) tend to give more importance to increasing the number
 of parameters and training data without adequate transparency or careful discretion of the data used. Ultimately, my main objective 
is to identify responsible practices for working with generative AI that addresses bias-related issues and promote transparency in the field.

		<h2>Experience</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>	
<li> 

I have experience as a Data Science research intern at Nanovery Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK as well as an assistant lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Gondar in Ethiopia. My expertise lies in Artificial Intelligence,
 Machine Learning, and Data Science, and I am proficient in programming languages (Python, C++, R, Java), statistical analysis, 
and machine learning frameworks.</li></ul> </p>
				
		
	<h2>Volunteer Activities </h2>
		
<p><ul><li>I actively participate in promoting diversity and increasing women's representation
 in AI as a core team member and volunteer at <a href="https://www.womeninairobotics.de/"> Women in AI and Robotics (WIAR).</a> 
 I serve as a mentor at<a href="https://www.meetmentors.org/kidist-amde"> MeetMentors </a>, where I offer mentorship and assistance to young, 
talented women studying in the STEAM fields in Africa. Additionally, I volunteered as a teaching Assistant at  <a "https://www.addiscoder.com/##staff"> AddisCoder </a> in 
	Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I had the privilege of working with Timnit Gebru and Professor Jelani Nelson. In addition to coordinating and teaching programming and algorithms to high schoolers, 
I also had the opportunity to assist and learn from these esteemed individuals. Mentoring female students alongside them and promoting gender equality in tech was an 
immensely fulfilling experience.
</li></ul></p>
