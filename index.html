		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Greetings! My name is Kidist, a recent MSc Data Science graduate from the University of Trento, Italy. 
I have a solid foundation in programming languages, statistical methods, and machine learning frameworks. I have earned
 two Master's degrees in Machine Intelligence and Data Science, as well as a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
I am enthusiastic about continuous learning, having pursued various online courses, and  AI events and talks such as
 conferences, workshops, summits, and hackathons to further my expertise in the fields of AI and Data Science.
			</p><p>
My research interest lies in Generative AI and multimodal learning (vision and language), specifically in the context of social good.
My main objective is on promoting positive outcomes, such as explainability,
 fairness, robustness, scalability, privacy, safety, and ethics, to ensure accountability and transparency in AI development.
</p>

		
		
		<h2>Ph.D. Research Interest Area</h2>
		<p>
           My research interest centers around creating explainable deep learning models that tackle biases towards
	   race and gender in generative models. Additionally, I'm intrigued by exploring responsible practices
	  when working with generative AI, in both large language models (LLMs) and image generation. I aim to examine
	the biases inherent in GANs and diffusion models, as well as the tendency of state-of-the-art LLMs to prioritize
	increasing the number of parameters and training data without transparency or discretion in data ingestion. Ultimately,
	my objective is to pinpoint responsible practices for working with generative AI, with a particular emphasis on addressing 
	issues related to bias and transparency in GenAI. </p>
		<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>B.Sc in Computer Science, University of Gondar, Sep 2013 - Jul 2017</p>
		<p>M.Sc in Machine intalligence  , African Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Oct 2019 - Dec 2020</p>
		<p>M.Sc in Data Science, University of Trento, Sep 2020 - Mar 2023</p>
		
		<h2>Experience</h2>
		
<p>I have experience as an assistant lecturer at the University of Gondar, Ethiopia, and as a Data Science research intern 
at Nanovery Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. My expertise lies in Artificial Intelligence,
 Machine Learning, and Data Science, and I am proficient in programming languages, statistical analysis, and machine learning frameworks.</p>
				
		
			<h2>Volunteer Activities </h2>
		
I actively participate in promoting diversity and increasing women's representation
 in AI as a core team member and volunteer at <a href="https://www.womeninairobotics.de/"> Women in AI and Robotics (WIAR).</a> 
 Additionally, I serve as a mentor at<a href="https://www.meetmentors.org/kidist-amde"> MeetMentors </a>, where I provide guidance and support to talented young students in Africa.
 I have been awarded the Turing AI Fellowship for Trustworthy Machine Learning.
