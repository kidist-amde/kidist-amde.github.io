		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Greetings!My name is Kidist, a recent MSc Data Science graduate from the University of Trento, Italy. 
I have a solid foundation in programming languages, statistical methods, and machine learning frameworks. I have earned
 two Master's degrees in Machine Intelligence and Data Science, as well as a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
I am enthusiastic about continuous learning, having pursued various online courses, and  AI events and talks such as
 conferences, workshops, summits, and hackathons to further my expertise in the fields of AI and Data Science.

My research interest lies in Generative AI and multimodal learning (vision and language), specifically in the context of social good.
My main objective is on promoting positive outcomes, such as explainability,
 fairness, robustness, scalability, privacy, safety, and ethics, to ensure accountability and transparency in AI development.
