		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi, I am a self-motivated and highly skilled individual holding two Master's degrees in Machine Intelligence and Data Science, along with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Additionally, I have a passion for self-learning and have pursued several online courses to enhance my skills.

I have experience as an assistant lecturer at the University of Gondar, Ethiopia, and as a Data Science research intern at Nanovery Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. My expertise lies in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science, and I am proficient in programming languages, statistical analysis, and machine learning frameworks.

My research interest lies in Generative AI and multimodal learning (vision and language) for social goods.  My primary aim is to ensure transparency and accountability in AI development while promoting positive outcomes such as explainability, fairness, robustness, scalability, privacy, safety, and ethics. 

I actively participate in promoting diversity and increasing women's representation in AI as a core team member and volunteer at Women in AI and Robotics (WIAR). Additionally, I serve as a mentor at MeetMentors, where I provide guidance and support to talented young students in Africa. I have been awarded the Turing AI Fellowship for Trustworthy Machine Learning.


My Ph.D. research interest centers around creating explainable deep learning models that tackle biases towards race and gender in generative models. Additionally, I'm intrigued by exploring responsible practices when working with generative AI, in both large language models (LLMs) and image generation. I aim to examine the biases inherent in GANs and diffusion models, as well as the tendency of state-of-the-art LLMs to prioritize increasing the number of parameters and training data without transparency or discretion in data ingestion. Ultimately, my objective is to pinpoint responsible practices for working with generative AI, with a particular emphasis on addressing issues related to bias and transparency in GenAI.
